            <h2>Considerations</h2>
            <p>Our risk model uses the classifier method to narrow contributing factors with high feature 
                importance for COVID-19 mortality predictions. The contributing factors are narrowed to age, gender, 
                and the top 6 features of each category in pre-existing conditions and symptoms. </p>
            <p>Logistic regression model is applied which shows an accuracy score of 0.88. Although the low-risk population f1-score 
            is 92%, the high risk population f1-score is only 66%, showing higher precision and recall for 
            low rather than high risk populations. </p>
            <p>The confusion matrix shows that the logistic regression model is able to accurately identify 87.5% ((75% true low risk 
            = predicted low risk) + (12.5% true high risk = predicted high risk)) of its test data into their respective risk categories which show 
            strong predictive capabilities.
